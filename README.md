<h1>Welcome To the Santa's List Web Application!!</h1>
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
<br>
<p>We as parents stress around the Holiday season racking our brains trying to figure out what our kids want to make them as happy as possible, 
   because let's face it no parent wants to see thier kid upset no matter how material or trivial it may seem.

   How cool would it be if the kid everytime they thought of something (I know it can be a lot!) they just enter it into a website that keeps track of all thier wishes, 
   and around the Holidays the parents can access it and select the appropriate one for their kids. You can even use it for other gift bearing occasions, birthdays, baby-showers, weddings, etc..! 
   It’s a wishlist for all ages and people alike! It’s a great way to keep track of any and every Idea you may have!!</p>
